# emoji-color-switcher-react

This project is a recreation of a [Scrimba tutorial project for learning Vue.js](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnvue).

## What's Different?

- **React**: The original project is made with Vue.
- **TypeScript**: The original project is made with plain JavaScript.

## What's the Same?

- **CSS**: The styling from the original project is used (although the emojis and colors are different).
