# emoji-color-switcher-react

This project is an emoji color switcher built using React. It is a recreation of a [Scrimba tutorial project for learning Vue.js](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnvue). It uses the same CSS and therefore looks the same; I wanted to focus on the actual React instead of worrying about creating my own CSS.
